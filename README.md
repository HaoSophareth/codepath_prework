# Prework - *WODpercents*

Submitted by: **Sophareth Hao**

**WODpercents** is a CrossFit training app that uses my one rep maxes and workout history to estimate the right weights, target times or reps, barbell setup, and warm-up progression for any WOD. It takes the guesswork out so I can train at the right intensity without a coach.

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. Apple Wallet
- see recent transactions of all my cards
- top up money for transit cards
- hold not just bank cards but everything from boarding passes to membership cards
2. Notion
- Datebase
- ‘/’ for commands
- View options
3. Google Calendar
- Recurring scheduling
- Multiple calendars
- Multiple time conversion for Home (Cambodia) and School (The US)
4. ChatGPT
- section my conversations
- go back through my history
- I don't have to write everything correctly for it to understand what I try to get out of my prompt

**App idea that you would like to build:**

WODpercents
- Record one rep max / WOD history
- WOD weight estimator
- WOD time / rep estimator 
- climbing warm up weight / rounds to workout weight
- barbell loader

I have all my one rep maxes and workout history recorded, so when I see a new WOD, I want to quickly scan it and get everything I need without second-guessing. Based on my numbers, I want the app to give me a weight that’s challenging but doable, along with an estimated time or rep target so I know how hard to push. It should also tell me exactly how to load my barbell and suggest a warm-up progression to climb up to my workout weight smoothly.

This wouldn’t replace a full gym app, but for someone like me, who can’t afford to do CrossFit at a box this summer, it fills in for a coach when I’m training on my own. Since WODs are available online, I just need an assistant that helps me hit the right intensity, choose the right weights, and follow a smart warm-up.

## Notes

One of the main challenges was struggling to follow the instructions, especially when it wasn’t clear what they were referring to. Also, the GIF was a bit user-unfriendly — I couldn’t pause it unless I opened it in full screen, so I had to wait and rewatch just to catch the part I needed. Sometimes it moved too fast to fully understand what was going on.
